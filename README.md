**DEPRECATED** September 2016: This repository has been deprecated in favor of [everypolitician-pull_request](https://github.com/everypolitician/everypolitician-pull_request). That library contains the core functionality of this web app and future enhancements should be added to that library.

# EveryPolitician data change summarizer

This is the code the EverPolitician bot uses to inspect data pull requests (specifically those are on the
[everypolitician-data](https://github.com/everypolitician/everypolitician-data) repo)
and add helpful summaries to them. The bot writes the summary as a comments on the Pull Request
(for example [like this](https://github.com/everypolitician/everypolitician-data/pull/13742#issuecomment-231612271)
or [this](https://github.com/everypolitician/everypolitician-data/pull/13771#issuecomment-231652178)). The summary
helps the human who then decides whether or not to merge the data.
